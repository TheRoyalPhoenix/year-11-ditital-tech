#str(55+65)The first line above will actually evaluate the mathematical equation and then convert it to a string of  character. So it will convert it to a string containing the value “150”. 
#int(55.0) The second line will convert the float to an integer – 55.
#float(44+10)The third line will convert the equation into a float, and become 54.0.
